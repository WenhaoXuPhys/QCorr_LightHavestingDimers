# QCorr_LightHarvestingDimers

This repository contains the Python code used in the manuscript:

"Quantum Correlation and Synchronisation-Enhanced Energy Transfer in Driven-Dissipative Light-Harvesting Dimers".

## Description
The code implements open quantum system simulations of driven–dissipative light-harvesting dimers and is used to compute energy-transfer efficiency, quantum correlations, and synchronisation measures reported in the manuscript.

## Requirements
Python 3.11  
numpy  
scipy  
qutip  
matplotlib  

## Usage
Run the main simulation using the Jupyter notebook:
`Photosynthesis_CodeforShare.ipynb`
